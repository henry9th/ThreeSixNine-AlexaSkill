# ThreeSixNine_AlexaSkill

### The game can be found in the skill store as '3 6 9' 

## Overview

Three Six Nine is traditionally a Korean counting game where each member of the game takes a turn counting by one. However, if one of the digits in the number contains a three, six, or nine, the player must clap. In addition, if the number is divisible by three, the player must clap. (ex. 1, 2, clap, 4 ... 11, clap, clap, 14) 

For this rendition of the game, the user must say “quack” rather than clapping. 

Update: Can play with more than one player by simply asking "Ask Three Six Nine to play with {numFriends} friends." Also so when a number contains more than one digit that is a three, six, or nine, the user must say "quack quack."

## Project Details

First time using AWS Lambda function to deploy code. It also took some time understanding writing a skill for Alexa. Besides the code for the lambda side of the skill, there are intents, slots, and utterances that were set up in the developer side.
